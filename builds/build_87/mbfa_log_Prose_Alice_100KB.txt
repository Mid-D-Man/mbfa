Original size: 800000 bits (100000 bytes)
Window diagnostics: 12825/18011 tokens are BACKREF (71.2%) | 0.0% at max window (131071 bytes) | 2.8% in upper half | offset_bits=17 — OK
Fold 1 adaptive: offset_bits=17 (window=131071 bytes)
Fold 1 (LZ): 385312 bits (48164 bytes)
Fold 2 pairing pre-scan: Cantor fallback rate = 89.2% (threshold 77%)
Fold 2 pairing skipped — high fallback rate
Fold 2 skipped — LZ on packed bytes not beneficial (current ratio 0.482, threshold 0.10)
Joint entropy applied: 48164 → 38906 bytes (table 374 B, stream 38532 B)
Done. 100000 bytes → 38910 bytes
