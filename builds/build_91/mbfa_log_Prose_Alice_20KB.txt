Original size: 160000 bits (20000 bytes)
Window diagnostics: 3022/5203 tokens are BACKREF (58.1%) | 0.0% at max window (32767 bytes) | 0.7% in upper half | offset_bits=15 — OK
Fold 1 adaptive: offset_bits=15 (window=32767 bytes)
Fold 1 (LZ): 94344 bits (11793 bytes)
Fold 2 pairing pre-scan: Cantor fallback rate = 79.1% (threshold 77%)
Fold 2 pairing skipped — high fallback rate
Fold 2 skipped — LZ on packed bytes not beneficial (current ratio 0.590, threshold 0.10)
Joint entropy v2 applied: 11793 → 8610 bytes (v1 would be 9267 B)
Done. 20000 bytes → 8614 bytes
