Original size: 353152 bits (44144 bytes)
Window diagnostics: 179/4563 tokens are BACKREF (3.9%) | 0.0% at max window (8191 bytes) | 87.2% in upper half | offset_bits=13 — HEAVY — large offsets dominant
Fold 1 adaptive: offset_bits=13 (window=8191 bytes)
Fold 1 (LZ): 47784 bits (5973 bytes)
Fold 2 pairing pre-scan: Cantor fallback rate = 98.3% (threshold 77%)
Fold 2 pairing skipped — high fallback rate
Fold 2 skipped — LZ on packed bytes not beneficial (current ratio 0.135, threshold 0.10)
Joint entropy applied: 5973 → 5669 bytes (table 812 B, stream 4857 B)
Done. 44144 bytes → 5673 bytes
