Window diagnostics: 404606/506904 tokens are BACKREF (79.8%) | 0.0% at max window (131071 bytes) | 25.2% in upper half | offset_bits=17 — OK
Fold 1 adaptive: offset_bits=17 (window=131071 bytes)
Fold 1 (LZ): 11542744 bits (1442843 bytes)
Fold 2 pairing pre-scan: Cantor fallback rate = 94.8% (threshold 77%)
Fold 2 pairing skipped — high fallback rate
Fold 2 skipped — LZ on packed bytes not beneficial (current ratio 0.429, threshold 0.10)
Joint entropy v3 applied: 1442843 → 1131263 bytes (v2=1131924 v1=1158407 B)
Done. 3359405 bytes → 1131267 bytes
