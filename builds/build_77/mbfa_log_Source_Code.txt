Original size: 37784 bits (4723 bytes)
Window diagnostics: 461/1311 tokens are BACKREF (35.2%) | 0.0% at max window (8191 bytes) | 1.7% in upper half | offset_bits=13 — OK
Fold 1 adaptive: offset_bits=13 (window=8191 bytes)
Fold 1 (LZ): 18648 bits (2331 bytes)
Fold 2 pairing pre-scan: Cantor fallback rate = 51.6% (threshold 77%)
Fold 2 (PAIR): 17800 bits (2225 bytes)
Fold 3 skipped — LZ on packed bytes not beneficial (current ratio 0.471, threshold 0.10)
Done. 4723 bytes → 2230 bytes
